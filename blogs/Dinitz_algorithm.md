Credits to CS 6820
This blog mainly focuses on the Dinitz algorithm. It looks very similar to the Hopcroft–Karp algorithm, not only in the properties they share but also in the structure of their proofs.

I also found some other properties in this algorithm (very minor improvements).

So this blog is basically a summary of the Dinitz algorithm, with a small extension based on my own understanding.

## Why Dinitz Algorithm


## Algorithm

## Run time analysis

## Compared with Hopcroft-Karp

## Some other properties

>Consider a flow network whose edge capacities lie in the set $\{0,1,2,\dots,C\}$, where $C$ is a constant and all capacities are integer-valued. Then the running time of Dinitz’s algorithm on this network is $O\!\left(m \cdot \min\left\{m^{1/2},\, n^{2/3}\right\}\right)$
